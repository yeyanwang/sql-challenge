The **employeeSQL - ERD.png** is an image file of the Entity Relationship Diagram which visually displays the structure of the tables and relationships between logically related tables of the database (This ERD was sketched using QUickDBD).

The **EmployeeSQL** folder contains two SQL files (**table_schemata.sql** and **employee_queries.sql**): 
* The **table_schemata.sql** file builds a relational database which contains tables that hold employees related data from imported csv files. Relationships are defined between tables and columns using primary keys, composite keys and foreign keys.
* The **employee_queries.sql** file quries the desired employee information.

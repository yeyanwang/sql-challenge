# EmployeeSQL

The `EmployeeSQL` folder contains two SQL files (`table_schemata.sql` and `employee_queries.sql`): 
* The `table_schemata.sql` file builds a relational database which contains tables that hold employees related data from imported csv files. Relationships are defined between tables and columns using primary keys, composite keys and foreign keys.
* The `employee_queries.sql` file quries the desired employee information.

### Entity Relationship Diagram 
The `employeeSQL - ERD.png` visually displays the structure of the tables and relationships between logically related tables of the database (This ERD was sketched using **QuickDBD**).
